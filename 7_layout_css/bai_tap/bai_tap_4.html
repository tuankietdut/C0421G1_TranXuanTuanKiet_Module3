                <p>Nobita's characterization depicts him as an incompetent and flawed person, including but not limited
                    to a lack of physical co-ordination or athletic talent, predisposition to laziness, reluctance to
                    engage in critical thinking, and sometimes exhibits childish or even perverted behavior. He dislikes
                    books and lacks a basic grasp of scientific knowledge, being unable to understand concepts such as
                    the definition of an eclipse. He often takes any chance to take a nap and favors gadgets that
                    provide convenience, and is often known as 'The Lazy King'. Whenever he possesses Doraemon's
                    gadgets, he shows them off to his classmate and future love interest Shizuka but not to his other
                    schoolmates Suneo and Gian. He envies Dekisugi, who is good at everything and admired by Shizuka.
                    Nobita's typical day consists of arriving late to school, falling asleep during class, scoring low
                    marks on his tests, getting scolded by his teacher and teased by Gian and Suneo, falling in the
                    curbside rain gutters, getting chased by dogs after stepping on them accidently, getting scolded by
                    his mother for not completing his tasks, and being bullied by people he knows except Shizuka.</p>
